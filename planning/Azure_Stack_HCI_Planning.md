# Welcome Kit - Azure Stack HCI - Planning - Draft


Welcome to the "Azure Stack HCI - Planning Welcome Kit." This
comprehensive guide is designed to provide you with essential insights
into the areas of focus and consideration when planning and designing
your Azure Stack HCI Deployment. As part of your preparation before
engaging with Microsoft engineers, this resource aims to demystify these
technologies, offering clear explanations and answers to frequently
asked questions. Whether you're new to these concepts or seeking to
deepen your understanding, this Welcome Kit is your stepping stone to
navigating the world of modern cloud-native solutions.Â 

## Requirements

As Azure Stack is a Hybrid Solution then this touches a number of areas
which normal Azure Deployments don't and in turn touches areas which a
traditional on-premises would not. In the following sections the
requirements across both will be discussed.

### Host Hardware Requirements

With Azure Stack HCI there are 2 options when selecting the hardware to
use as part of the deployment. Working with a Hardware OEM they can
provide either a Validated or an Integrated system. With the Validate
System all the hardware has been tested and validated to support Azure
Stack HCI and will be delivered just as the base hardware and will
require the firmware, operating system and drivers to be installed by
the customer/partner. With the Integrated System again the hardware has
been tested and validated to support Azure Stack HCI but with these
systems the firmware, operating system, and drivers to be pre-installed.

Details about the these systems is available within the [HCI
Catalog][catalog]
and can be used as a foundation to go into the discussions with Hardware
OEM's to find the correct hardware for your requirements.

### Network Switch Requirements

As Azure Stack HCI is a hyper-converged platform the physical network
which links the nodes together and to the rest of the network are very
important to help deliver the performance and availability required.
Depending on the purpose of the of the switch, whether it be dedicated
for management, storage or compute, or indeed for multiple of these
roles then they need to support certain [industry standards][switchrequirements].

Additionally, certain switch vendors have worked with Microsoft to
[validated their switches][validatedswitched] for each of these roles

Despite this list being available you are free to use any switch as long
as it meets the requirements for the relevant role (e.g. for a switch
used for the storage then all of the storage required standards are
needed)

### Active Directory Requirements

As the Azure Stack HCI cluster is a Windows Failover Cluster Instance
running Hyper-V and S2D then an Active Directory Domain Servers are
required. Additional once the cluster is deployed it is advised to grant
the cluster computer object permissions to the OU which the nodes and
cluster computer object are within. This is needed to allow for the
creation and modification to AD objects when roles and services are
deployed on the cluster. Also it would be recommended to disabled GPO
inheritance and then only apply the GPO's specific to Azure Stack HCI.

Sometimes these types of changed are not appropriate so there is the
option to use a fabric domain which will allow more "flexibility" to
these changes as it is limited to your Azure Stack HCI cluster(s).

The final point around the AD requirements is that AD is required to
allow the cluster to actually start so this means that, domain
controllers can run on the Azure Stack HCI cluster there needs to be
Domain Controllers reachable from the nodes when they boot.

### Azure Requirements

Azure Stack HCI required to be registered with an Azure subscription and
then synchronize with Azure at a minimum of every 28 days to allow full
cluster functionality. The [registration requirements][azurerequirements] are only certain regions are supported, these regions only hold "metadata" about your cluster and no data from the service running on Azure Stack HCI is stored in this region.

### Firewall Requirements

As part of the hybrid capabilities of Azure Stack HCI then there are
required to be a number of firewall ports and addresses which need to be
allow. The following documents list out those that are required,
recommended and those for additional services such as AKS, ARC VM
Management, etc

-   [Required Rules][requiredrules]

-   [Recommended Rules][recommendedrules]

-   [Additional Services][additionalrules]

In addition to these firewall rules for the outbound internet access
there are [rules required for internal traffic flows][internalrules], such as between
nodes and with management machines, DC's ectc. 

## Environment Validation

Once the all of the above requirements are met then they can be
validated using the [Environment Checker][enviromentchecker] can then be used to validate the
following:

-   **Connectivity validator**. Checks whether each server in the
    cluster meets the connectivity requirements. For example, each
    server in the cluster has internet connection and can connect via
    HTTPS outbound traffic to well-known Azure endpoints through all
    firewalls and proxy servers.

-   **Hardware validator**. Checks whether your hardware meets the
    system requirements. For example, all the servers in the cluster
    have the same manufacturer and model.

-   **Active Directory validator**. Checks whether the Active Directory
    preparation tool is run prior to running the deployment.

-   **Network validator**. Validates your network infrastructure for
    valid IP ranges provided by customers for deployment. For example,
    it checks there are no active hosts on the network using the
    reserved IP range.

-   **Arc integration validator**. Checks if the Azure Stack HCI cluster
    meets all the prerequisites for successful Arc onboarding.


## Quorum

To allow for the Windows Failover Cluster to function, the quorum is the mechanism which determines the viability of the cluster avaialbility and is used to determin action in the event of any failures, whether they be host, network or storage.  There are 2 types of quroum to consider when planning Azure Stack HCI and these are the Cluster Quorum and the Storage Pool Quorum.

### Cluster Quorum

The Cluster Quorum it is advised that when having particular number of nodes is to have a [witness][clusterquorum] which can provide the an additional "vote" to determine the actions performed in the event of a failure.  The [expected outcome][clusterquorumexamples] when one or node failes or is unrepsonsive differs based on the number of nodes and the presence of a witness.

The witness can is traditionally a file share which needs to be contactable by all nodes and will be referenced in the change of the cluster "state".  There are 2 option for the file share witness:

-   **SMB fileshare** is a file share is referenced by UNC Path and each of the cluster nodes needs to have access to the UNC path using the Cluster Computer Object.  The fileshare should be hosted from a location which is avaialble even with the partical failure of some of the nodes, and not on the Azure Stack HCI Cluster itself
-   **Cloud Witness** is a storage account [hosted in Azure][cloudwitness] which can be accessible over the internet or via a private endpoint but again should be access by all nodes in the cluster, the access is grant to this with the used if the endpoint URL and the access key.

Setting of of the witness can be complete using with [WAC][wacwitness] or [PowerShell][powershellwintess]

### Storage Pool Quorum

The Storage Pool Quorum works independently from the Cluster Quorum as this is designed for clustered and none cluster environment.  Depending on the number of nodes in the system and the presense of a witness dictates the [expected outcome][poolwintessexamples].  Each disk which makes up the storage pool has a vote towards establish quorum of the pool.  It is recommended that each node in your cluster is symmetrical (each node has the same number of drives), and in the event that this is an even number then the owner of the storage pool will also recieve a vote to help establish this.

The requirement for the pool to remain in quorum (online) is that 50% + 1 of the votes should be available.  An additional considering is with cluster with 5 nodes or more is that if more than two nodes are down, or two nodes and a disk on another node are down, volumes may not have access to all three copies of their data, and therefore be taken offline and be unavailable. It's recommended to bring the servers back or replace the disks quickly to ensure the most resiliency for all the data in the volume.  This can be helped with the following of the guidelines for the [reserved capapcity][reservedcapacity] as this will allow the capacity for data on failed disks to be written to the reserved space.


## Storage

The storage for Azure Stack HCI is built using [Storage Space Direct (S2D)][s2doverview] and pools all of the capacity disk within a cluster into a storage pool and then volumes are created within that pool using one of the support resiliency types.  the data is the broken down into [slabs][s2dslabs] and then distributed across all disks within the storage pool, ensure that the slabs are located in adherence with the resiliency type for the volume.  It also has the ability to have a caching tier which can help increase performance by having a higher speed disk used for caching and then slower disks for the actual capapcity storage.

### Storage Resiliency and Fault Tolerance

Within Azure Stack HCI there are the following levels of resilency:

- [Two-way Mirror][Twowaymirror]
- [Three-way Mirror][threewaymirror]
- [Parity][parity]
  - [Single Parity][singleparity]
  - [Dual Parity][dualparity]
  - [Mirror-accelerated parity][mirroraccelerateoairty]

Depending on the level of resiliency select then the [storage effiency][storageeffiency] and [number of nodes][storageminimumnodes] required will change, as well as the potential perfomance and use cases.

![Resiliency type comparison](Resiliency-type-comparison.png "Resiliency type comparison")

### Storage Pool Cache

When creating a storage pool there are 2 types for the storage pool which are based on the types of disks.  These are [all flash][allflashpool] and hybrid [hybridpool].  With a all flash pool then this can be all SSD, all NVMe or a mix of these 2 types.  If there is a mix of these types then the faster disk will be selected and used as the cache tier and these will not be used towards the capacity of the storage pool.  If thestorage pool is made up HDD's then there also need to be SSD's and/or NVMe's to provide the caching tier.

When sizing the cache disks it is advised to have the number of cache disks to be [a multiple of the capapcity disks][cachediskratio].  The allocation of the cahce disks to the capacity disks is dynamic and will adjust accordingly if disks are added or removed, or fail.

The [cache behaviour][cachebehaviour] is determined by the storage pool type with All Flash using the cache for writes but not reads, where as the Hybrid type cache is used for both reads and writes.
